The simplified real frequency technique is an optimal filter design scheme. For
details about how this particular scheme works I have included a PDF in this
repository (Introduction.pdf) that will do its best to explain the fundamentals.
It will be most useful to review this. It requires at least an introductory
understanding of circuit theory. For additional resources, I highly recommend:
